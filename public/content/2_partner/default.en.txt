Jewish immigrants from numerous countries (8 different languages) but especially from the former Soviet Union (70% of the members), give the congregation a multi-cultural expression. Traditional Jewish elements like the reading from their own Torah scroll characterize the services which are held in Hebrew with simultaneous translations into English and Russian. The congregation has built up a widespread network of homegroups organized according to languages, which will permit the creation of new future congregations in the greater Netanya area. Beit Asaph is co-equally led by Evan Thomas, a Jew from New Zealand who immigrated in the early 80's, and Lev Guler, who immigrated with his family in the 90's from Russia.","id":"_kcc42cxq9","type":"paragraph"}]
